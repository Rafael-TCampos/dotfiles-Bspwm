# quickshell shell for bspwm

The full desktop shell: bar, popups, wallpaper-driven theming, and the
network app. bspwm needs **no patch** — `bspc subscribe report` streams
every desktop/layout change, and actions go straight through `bspc`.
Note bspwm ignores dock struts: the bar's space is reserved via monitor
`top_padding`, which `Bar.qml` syncs per monitor on startup and whenever
the bar height changes (that sync is also what re-tiles windows live
while dragging the height/scale sliders).

Launch: `qs -p ~/.config/bspwm/quickshell` (bspwmrc does this), or
`scripts/bar restart|log` which handles the `-p` flag.

## Portability contract (read before porting to another WM)

This tree is the **reference implementation** for a shell that is vendored
per WM project (openbox next). Cohesion across projects comes from keeping
the shared files byte-identical — `diff -r` between two projects' quickshell
dirs should show only the files listed as WM-specific.

**Shared verbatim (do not fork per WM):**
`Theme.qml` `BarModule.qml` `Popout.qml` `WallpaperPicker.qml`
`Weather.qml` `NotifyPopup.qml` `Network.qml` `CalendarPopup.qml`
`Clock.qml` `Media.qml` `Metrics.qml` `Volume.qml` `Tray.qml` `Bell.qml`
`CapsLock.qml` `Screenshot.qml` `PowerButton.qml` `Launcher.qml` `Title.qml`
`Sys.qml` `TweakSlider.qml` `Commands.qml` `MicMute.qml` `MediaPopup.qml`
`Updates.qml` — plus `scripts/wallpaper-theme` (all but its WM tail),
`scripts/network`, `scripts/bar`, and the `quickshell-network/` app.
(`Commands.qml` and `Updates.qml` are shared with dwm-setup too, differing
only in the terminal they spawn — `kitty` here, `st` there.)

**WM-specific (rewrite per WM):**
- `Wm.qml` — bspwm backend (`bspc subscribe report`). For EWMH WMs
  (openbox etc.) replace with an `xprop -spy`-based backend
  (`_NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, `_NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS`, client list).
  Titles already come from EWMH xprop and port unchanged.
- `Tags.qml` — driven by Wm's seltags/occtags/urgtags bitmasks; keep the
  visuals, feed from the new backend.
- `LayoutButton.qml` `LayoutPicker.qml` `LayoutIcon.qml` + `scripts/layout`
  — bspwm-only (scripts/layout engine); drop for floating WMs.
- Tail of `scripts/wallpaper-theme` — bspwm: colors.sh borders + bspwmrc
  persistence + `bspc wm -r`. Other WMs: generate their theme file
  (openbox: themerc) + their reload command.

**Interfaces that must never drift between projects:**
- `polybar/colors.ini` palette keys (background, background-alt, foreground,
  primary, secondary, alert, disabled, border) — Theme.qml's watch target.
- `wallpaper-theme <image> <8 semantic> <16 ansi>` argument order.
- IPC targets: `wallpapers` (toggle/random/set), `tweaks` (toggle),
  `commands` (toggle), `wm` (refreshLayout, bspwm only).
- Script names in `scripts/`: wallpaper-theme, network, bar, layout.
- Bar-tweaks state file names: `bar-height` and `bar-scale` in the WM
  config dir (Theme.qml's watch targets, plain integers/floats).

## Live theming

`Theme.qml` watches `polybar/colors.ini`, which `scripts/wallpaper-theme`
rewrites on every wallpaper pick — the bar re-colors in place, no restart.
The picker extracts the palette in QML (Canvas histogram; fidelity mode for
flat designed art, pastel interpretation for photos). A beacon check runs
first: a small, bright, hue-distinct cluster — a lamp, neon sign, sunset
sliver — becomes the accent even though it barely registers in the
histogram, and the dominant field hue steps down to secondary; images
without one behave exactly as before and the script fans it
out to bar/rofi/dunst/kitty/GTK/borders. Dunst's config is symlinked from
`~/.config/dunst/dunstrc` so D-Bus-spawned dunst is themed too.

Keybindings: `super+shift+t` wallpaper picker · `super+n` network app ·
`super+t` cycle layouts · `super+shift+m` command menu · `super+ctrl+r`
restart the bar.

The command menu (󰘳, right end of the bar) is the quick-settings panel:
actions with **no other bar surface**. A 2-col grid of toggle pills
(filled = on; right-click opens the full tool where one exists —
mic → pavucontrol's input tab): power profile cycle, keep-screen-awake,
mic mute, night light, DND (right-click = notification history; the Bell
module is CapsLock-pattern now — on the bar only while DND is active, so
the silenced state stays glanceable), and a pomodoro (countdown + drain
bar show on the 󰘳 pill itself; right-click cycles 15/25/45/60 presets,
scroll nudges ±5 min, idle only). Below: brightness slider (laptops with
a backlight only), then launcher rows — apt updates, keybind help, bar
restart, and the rofi power menu (which replaced the old PowerButton
module — the file stays for other ports). Stateful glanceable modules
(volume, network, DND, media) never move in here. IPC: `commands toggle`.

Bar tweaks: the layout button's Desktop section (also reached by
right-clicking an empty stretch of the bar) has **bar height**
(36–72 px) and **element scale** (0.7–2.0×) sliders alongside the bspc
ones. Element scale resizes fonts, icons, module pills, tags, and tray
(popups stay fixed); height is a floor, not a cap — the bar grows to fit
when scaled elements outgrow it. Both persist to plain live-watched
files — `bar-height` and `bar-scale` in the bspwm dir — so `echo 48 >
~/.config/bspwm/bar-height` works identically. Defaults (42 / 1.0) apply
when the files are absent.

Weather config: right-click the module → rofi flow (`scripts/weather`) for
location (city/zip/airport; empty = auto by IP) and units (°F/°C/auto by
locale). State is two plain live-watched files — `weather-location` and
`weather-units` in the bspwm dir — so `echo`/`rm` work identically for
scripts. Location auto-detect follows VPN exit nodes; the popup's 󰍎 line
shows which location the data is actually for.

Design grammar: indicators sit flat on the bar or icon-only — no
hover-expanding labels (a module growing on hover shifts the
right-anchored row out from under the cursor); details live in popups
and apps, and Volume's label flashes only on change. Pill backgrounds
mean "clickable". One popup per module — no hub:
three hub concepts (card, side panel, expanding deck) were built and
retired; every control lives in its module's obvious place. Anything
needing keyboard input (wifi passwords) is a floating window with its own
qs instance, not a popup. All popups share `Popout.qml` (card chrome +
click-outside/Escape close) — never hand-roll popup chrome. Battery joins
the flat metrics on laptops. VPN state (vpn/wireguard/tun) shows as a
green shield on the network module; the network app can toggle saved VPN
profiles (NM-managed vpn/wireguard only — externally managed tunnels
like tailscale show the shield and a read-only "external" row, but no
toggle: nmcli can down them but never bring them back), and carries the
bluetooth manager (power, paired-device connect/disconnect, PIN-less
pairing via "pair new"; PIN pairing stays blueman's job) — the section
renders only when an adapter exists.

## Development notes

- New QML type → add to `qmldir` **and** fully restart (`scripts/bar
  restart`). Hot reload registers no new types and can leave stale handler
  trees running — never trust it for behavior changes.
- Debug: `scripts/bar log` · IPC surface: `scripts/bar ipc show`.

## Fallback

Bar dies the moment you click it: check `~/.icons/default/index.theme`
for a self-referential Inherits loop — nwg-look ≤1.0.2 (what trixie
ships) generates one applying a cursor theme, and libxcb-cursor
recurses forever resolving the click cursor (found by ddubs, Aug 2026;
fixed upstream in nwg-look 1.0.3, issue #90). Delete the file or fix
the chain.

Uncomment the polybar line in bspwmrc and comment the qs line. If quickshell
misbehaves: `scripts/bar restart`.
